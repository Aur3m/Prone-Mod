Message to reader:
	If you intend on leaking this addon I can't stop you. Although it is a compliment to see people trying
	to get their hands on my code it is also shitty because well, you're stealing it from me. All I ask is that before
	leaking my addon you place yourself in my shoes and think about how much it sucks to have something
	you spent hours making being given out by someone else for free. Other than that, enjoy it anyways!

Lua Documentation:
	function Player:IsProne()							-- Shared (Networked). Returns if the player is currently prone
	function Player:HandleProne()					-- Shared (Should be ran on both to work). Decides if the player can, then either puts them into or exits them from prone
	
	function prone.StartProne(player, CalledOnServerOnly)
		-- The second arguement should be true if prone.StartProne() is being called somewhere that is SERVER only.
		-- The second arguement can be omitted if ran shared.
		
	function prone.StopProne(player, forced, CalledOnServerOnly)
		-- The second arguement will force the player out of prone without an animation, instantly.
		-- The third arguement is the same as the second arguement in prone.StartProne(). Read it above.
		
	Any other functions shouldn't really called by themselves because doing so will probably mess something up.
